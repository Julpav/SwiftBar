# SwiftBar Plugin
SwiftBar is a Roblox Studio plugin which is designed to replicate a spotlight search bar (as seen in MacOS and other operating systems), with more than just a search feature. SwiftBar, also referred to as ‘The Bar’, helps developers efficiently perform tasks within studio without having to use your mouse. The efficiency applied from the plugin relys purely on the users muscle memory with commands and shortcuts.
# How-to-use
### First time using it?
You may be prompted to setup the Plugin before using. This will only take a sec.
In the future, if you may need to reset the Plugin settings, you can reset it by uninstalling/reinstalling or running the “reset confirm” command in the Bar.

**Enable the Bar by running the command** ```SHIFT + F```
